WriteLiteral("\r\n\r\n<h1>Get Started</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The DeviceHive API is the central part of the fram" +
"ework which allows different components to interact with each other.\r\nThe API pr" +
"ovides access to information about registered components in the system, and allo" +
"ws them to exchange messages in real time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There" +
" are three types of consumers of the DeviceHive API, as shown on the diagram bel" +
"ow:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{image-path}/Images/UseCases.png\" alt=\"Use Cases\" />\r\n\r\n<h3" +
">Device</h3>\r\n<p>Device is a unit that runs microcode, and it communicates with " +
"the API for in following cases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>When started, device register" +
"s within the framework by passing unique identifier, display name and other meta" +
"-information.</li>\r\n    <li>Device sends notifications with an arbitrary content" +
" format to notify other components about the changes in the device\'s environment" +
".</li>\r\n    <li>Device listens for commands issued by other components and execu" +
"tes them in an appropriate way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Client</h3>\r\n<p>Client is an " +
"application that is used to monitor and/or control devices.\r\nIt could be a user " +
"interface, or completely automated software that manages the entire device netwo" +
"rk.\r\nClients may invoke the API in the following use cases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>C" +
"lient enumerates all the devices in the network, view their status and other met" +
"a-information.</li>\r\n    <li>Client listens for device notifications and process" +
"es them in an appropriate way.</li>\r\n    <li>Client sends commands to devices to" +
" trigger any logic on the device side.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Administrator</h3>\r\n<p" +
">Administrator controls all aspects of the environment with the full access to t" +
"he API.\r\nCommonly, administrators will need to use this API in the following cas" +
"es:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Administrator creates and manages API users (clients and " +
"other administrators).</li>\r\n    <li>Administrator creates and manages device ne" +
"tworks and associates users with them.</li>\r\n    <li>Administrator monitors devi" +
"ces and all dispatched notifications and commands.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resources<" +
"/h2>\r\n<p>The DeviceHive API is a RESTful service, which operates on several reso" +
"urce types.\r\nThe diagram below reflects all used resource types and their relati" +
"onships:</p>\r\n<img src=\"{image-path}/Images/DataModel.png\" alt=\"Data Model\" />\r\n" +

"h2>\r\n<p>The API supports two types of authentication: User and Device.</p>\r\n\r\n<h" +
"3>User</h3>\r\n<p>The users are authenticated using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.o" +
"rg/wiki/Basic_access_authentication\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP Basic Authentication</" +

"\r\n<p>Devices are authenticated by passing two custom HTTP headers:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  " +
"  <li><strong>Auth-DeviceID</strong>: Device unique identifier.</li>\r\n    <li><s" +
